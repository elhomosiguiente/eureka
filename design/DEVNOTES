is for design and development purposes only.

ACTIONS & EVENTS

- Each icon can have exactly one action associated with it.

- Each action can trigger several events.

- While the editor supports setting actions, events have to be
  handcoded.  To see how, check out the parser functions in map.cc.

MAP

- Lots of islands; makes the game more interesting (see black 
  D&D manual)

CITIES

- Closed at night, say, btw. 8pm - 6am

- No time passes in city

- No camping possible, only renting a room at night

  -> This avoids having to make people go to bed at night, etc.

DISPLAY

- Show icons for effects of spells, torches, etc. siilar to Bard's
  Tale

- Show in the bottom of window a graphic that shows weather,
  state of sun, moon, etc.

BATTLE

- At night, monsters have advantage over players (in day it is
  inverted)
