TODO
=====

- Fix SquareArena::is_illuminated: 
  Illumination of icons doesn't work, e.g., when entering Lendom at 22:00, one can see it clearly.

- NPCs & dogs (prio med, skill high)

- Make game characters definable in Lua

- Problem is: coord selection and other keyboard input sometimes seems sluggish.  It's not cause the game is slow, but because
  we only redraw when TICK event occurs.  Perhaps, update effects of keyboard input immediately?

IN PROGRESS
============

- Implement service purchase such as healing

DONE
=====

- Select multiple items cannot select multiple items in multiple quantities. Change return value of select_items to pair of ints!

- In game music (prio low, skill low)

- Separate music channels in soundsample automatically (music has one, with defined volume, samples have one with defined volume; prio: low, skill: low)

- Level up (already started in party.cc)

- Luaapi.cc sell items doesn't work with new item desc showing up in inventory. String breakup probably wrong inside the method! [prio high, skill low]

- Check that save-game still works - perhaps write test for it? [prio med, skill med]

- FIX SAVE GAME. Also: When saving a game, first delete old save game or previously lying around map data may be outdated.
  (This only happens when a new game is created. Perhaps store a hex to compare if new game was created, and then create new dir, otherwise use existing dir?)

- Potions [prio med, skill med]

- Buy remedies for magic (e.g., herbs, magic potions) and healing (i.e., implement healer and reanimator shop) (prio high, skill low)

- Shift load stuff into GameState, where it belongs and free eureka.cc

- Magic system (prio high, skill high)

- Change all paths to boost::filesystem::path for modularity and allowing new worlds to be included as well as future OS interoperability

- Create different foes inside combat.cc rather than just one type (prio low, skill med)

- Appearance of random monsters in dungeon (prio low, skill med)

- Spell points recover from walking + resting (prio: med, skill low)

- Level up (prio high, skill med) (DONE: Monk in Stadtkarte is an example)

- AFTER TAXING TO TAXER AND PISSING HIM OFF, THE GUARD FOLLOW MECHANISM LEADS TO STACK OVERFLOW [SEVERE]

- Locks and lock shop (prio high, skill med)

- Rest party

- Consume (DONE)/buy (DONE) food

- Close cities at night, make radius smaller (DONE, except radius should be round rather than squared)

- DONE: Save/load game.  Store modified city maps?
  (Add additional items, TODO)

- Switches and other items that are scripted. (sort of, DONE, via events; won't attach events directly to objects though for now)
 
- Add weapons, arms, etc. from elements.xml.old to main elements.xml
  and extend world.cc to read and use these properties.  [DONE]

- Add icon property which is a number in the sequence of animations,
  so that icons animate automatically.  Store the animation sequences
  in hash table.  [DONE]

- Leibniz does not yet save monster data and similar game data,
  so far only reading of data is possible via world.cc. 

  Put such files in separate XML file which is NOT read by editor
  but only by game.  So nothing gets overwritten inside the world
  file. [DONE - elements.xml]

- Inventory weight, etc. (DONE)

BUGS
=====

- GameState does not save games properly and cannot do indoors game saving...

- Game crashes after conversations with town folks

- Save T.O.D. with game status

- Do not let players ready an item like a jimmy lock! [MED]

- When first 3 in a party of 4 die during battle, program seems to crash during battle [SEVERE]
  SOLUTION? When member dies put immediately in the back of party, so that alive members move forward.

- Inside gamecontrol::ready_item do not recreate readied items or the number of turns that a torch
  lasts will be reset each time it is unreadied/readied. (Is this fixed? CHECK!)
