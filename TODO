TODO
=====

- Check that save-game still works - perhaps write test for it? [prio med, skill med]

- Buy remedies for magic (e.g., herbs, magic potions) and healing (i.e., implement healer and reanimator shop) (prio high, skill low)

- NPCs (prio med, skill high)

- Potions [prio med, skill med]

- Add shepherd that joins party, called EMMA (prio: med, skill low)

- Separate music channels in soundsample automatically (music has one, with defined volume, samples have one with defined volume; prio: low, skill: low)

- In game music (prio low, skill low)

IN PROGRESS
============

- Magic system (prio high, skill high) [MOSTLY DONE BUT VARIOUS BUGS EXIST STILL.]

DONE
=====

- Change all paths to boost::filesystem::path for modularity and allowing new worlds to be included as well as future OS interoperability

- Create different foes inside combat.cc rather than just one type (prio low, skill med)

- Appearance of random monsters in dungeon (prio low, skill med)

- Spell points recover from walking + resting (prio: med, skill low)

- Level up (prio high, skill med) (DONE: Monk in Stadtkarte is an example)

- AFTER TAXING TO TAXER AND PISSING HIM OFF, THE GUARD FOLLOW MECHANISM LEADS TO STACK OVERFLOW [SEVERE]

- Locks and lock shop (prio high, skill med)

- Rest party

- Consume (DONE)/buy (DONE) food

- Close cities at night, make radius smaller (DONE, except radius should be round rather than squared)

- DONE: Save/load game.  Store modified city maps?
  (Add additional items, TODO)

- Switches and other items that are scripted. (sort of, DONE, via events; won't attach events directly to objects though for now)
 
- Add weapons, arms, etc. from elements.xml.old to main elements.xml
  and extend world.cc to read and use these properties.  [DONE]

- Add icon property which is a number in the sequence of animations,
  so that icons animate automatically.  Store the animation sequences
  in hash table.  [DONE]

- Leibniz does not yet save monster data and similar game data,
  so far only reading of data is possible via world.cc. 

  Put such files in separate XML file which is NOT read by editor
  but only by game.  So nothing gets overwritten inside the world
  file. [DONE - elements.xml]

- Inventory weight, etc. (DONE)

BUGS
=====

- Do not let players ready an item like a jimmy lock! [MED]

- When first 3 in a party of 4 die during battle, program seems to crash during battle [SEVERE]
  SOLUTION? When member dies put immediately in the back of party, so that alive members move forward.

- Save T.O.D. with game status

- Save game only in wilderness, not in cities or dungeons

- Inside gamecontrol::ready_item do not recreate readied items or the number of turns that a torch
  lasts will be reset each time it is unreadied/readied. (Is this fixed? CHECK!)
