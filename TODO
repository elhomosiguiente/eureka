- Add weapons, arms, etc. from elements.xml.old to main elements.xml
  and extend world.cc to read and use these properties.  [DONE]

- Add icon property which is a number in the sequence of animations,
  so that icons animate automatically.  Store the animation sequences
  in hash table.  [DONE]

- Leibniz does not yet save monster data and similar game data,
  so far only reading of data is possible via world.cc. 

  Put such files in separate XML file which is NOT read by editor
  but only by game.  So nothing gets overwritten inside the world
  file. [DONE - elements.xml]
