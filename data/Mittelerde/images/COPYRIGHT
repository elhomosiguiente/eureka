Indoors icons consist of a collection of icons from the following
sources:

- The GPL open source game Nazghul/Haxima:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/nazghul/

- Various tile collections which are free for non-commercial use and 
  whose copyright notices and originals are available inside the
  originals/ directory, sorted by the source/author.

Outdoors icons are created by myself entirely.
